# Web-Scraping

First of all we give some basic information on how a website is built - explaining a bit about HTML.
We then show how to web scrape tables and other information sources with a CSS Selector and without.
Next web scraping on dynamic data that changes over time.
Here we use machine learning methods to count cars that appear on a publically available web cam of a big street in a German city.
At last we present APIs as a less error-prone alternative to web scraping.
